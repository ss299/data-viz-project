##Introduction

Welcome to Group 19's research into the impacts of purchasing power and food access on child health and wellbeing. We wish to understand:
**To what extent does purchasing power affect food consumption and access, and what implications do they have on child mortality?**
To understand this further, we divded the question into three segments to explore the intracaies of this global phenomenon. These questions are:
*To what extent does purchasing power impact medical spending and child mortality?*
*To what extent does purchasing power impact the consumption and wastage of food?*
*How does the ability to purchase food impact child mortality?*
We hope that through our illustrations, you will be able to discover for yourself the connection within the data.

##Background on Data

The datasets for these illustrations have come from a variety of global reporting sources. Through extensive searching, we eventually settled on data originating from these sources:

The World Bank

Our data on PPP and food wastage came from the World Bank. They provide a large amount of workable data regarding the world economic status.

FAO
http://www.fao.org/faostat
FAO provided information about food status and the food CPI on countries. They also contain a large amount of agriculture and food related data.

UNICEF
https://data.unicef.org
UNICEF provided information on child mortality data. They also have large repositories of child and family development data.
